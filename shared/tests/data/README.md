# Generating test data
The input data used in these tests was generated using the random number generator functions in the [NumPy] (https://github.com/numpy/numpy) python library.

The expected results were calculated using the coordinate conversion functions found in the [astropy] (https://github.com/astropy/astropy) python library.
