	\section{Overview of Document}
	This document seeks to review our original Project Proposal and explain how it has been implemented. It will explore the decisions our team has taken to respond to problem and how this has effected the implementation of the Project Plan.

	\section{Terms of Reference}
		\subsection {Goals}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Measurably improve robot architecture.
				\item Make robot dance, possibly in response to some stimulus.
			\end{enumerate}
		\subsection {Objectives}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Decrease the time it takes to add a new component to the system.
				\item Increase the performance of the system
				\item Improve diagnostics/monitoring tools by providing increased visibility into the state of the system.
				\item Decrease the time it takes to induct a new team member into the system.
				\item Improve utilization of existing and future robot hardware.
				\item Improve the consistency of interfaces between components.
				\item Improve the ability to move the architecture between different robot platforms.
				\item Investigate the possibilities of making the robot dance according to a predetermined script, in response to music or a detected humanâ€™s movements. Also implementing these possibilities if practical.
			\end{enumerate}
		\subsection {Scope}
			The project aims to measurably improve the effectiveness of the NUBots through the introduction of a new software architecture. This will involve modifications to the existing NUBots codebase. The project will not modify any hardware on the NUbots but must be able to accommodate changes in hardware. The project will not change any existing algorithms beyond restructuring them to fit the new architecture.
			\\Additional we aim to give the robot the ability to dance in some form for marketing purposes. This dancing will be according to a predetermined script, or in response to some stimulus such as music or human movement detected in a camera.
		\subsection {Acceptance Criteria}
			The acceptance criteria will consist of achieving measurable improvements on the characteristics of the system outlined in section 1.2 (Objectives). Specific measurements need to be negotiated with the client at a later time.
		\subsection {Review of changes to Goals, Objectives, Scope and Acceptance Criteria}
			An review of how these categories have changed since the original Project Proposal.
			\subsubsection{Goals}
				The goals of the project remain unchanged since the initial Project Proposal.
			\subsubsection{Objectives}
				The objectives of the project are unchanged with the exception of objective 8. Due to team members leaving, the objective of making the robot dance to according to visual stimuli has been abandoned.
			\subsubsection{Scope}
				The scope of the project remains unchanged since the initial Project Proposal, except the refinement of the dance to being only scripted and in response to music.
			%TODO
			\subsubsection{Acceptance Criteria}
				The Acceptance Criteria remans the same.

		\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{l  X  X X  X  X X}
			\hline
			Rank & Name & Chance & Severity & Mitigation Strategy & Contingency \\ \hline
			1 & Project not completed by dealine & Low & High & Do our work & Remove features. Finish after deadline. NUBot team finished project. \\ \hline
			2 & Documentation not completed by deadline & Medium & Medium & Assign specific tasks for completion of documentation & Negotiate extension. \\ \hline
			3 & Conflict in Team & Medium & Medium & Listen to all group members opinions. & Attempt to accomodate group memebers opinions. Make group decision on difficult choices \\ \hline
			4 & Jake can no longer do the project, losing his c++ skills. & Low & High & Other term members gain understanding of his c++ code. & Less ambitious use of c++. Possibly designing a different architecture that is easier to implement. \\ \hline
			5 & NUBot team cancelled & Very Low & Very High & None & Make project more general, as an architecture with no implentation in the NUBots \\ \hline

		\subsection{Review of Risks}
			An overview of what risks occured and how well we responded to them.
			\subsubsection{Unanticipated Risks}
				\paragraph{Project Members Leaving}  
					Although we had discussed this possibility, we failed to thoroughly plan how to respond to it. Fortunately it was only members of the Dance Focus Group who left the team as the Dance part of the project was much easier to scale back than the Architecture part of the project. Despite this, members of the Architecture Focus Group were still required to help out with the Dance part of the project.
			\subsubsection{Anticipated Risks}
				\paragraph{Transferring to New Architecture behind schedule}  
					Due to failing to anticipate how time consuming tranferring the old system to the new architechure would be, it was realised that it could not be completed in time. Fortunately the team had considered this possibility and was ready to deal with it. It was decided, as according to our contingency plan, that we would simply do the best we could and leave the rest for the NUBots team to complete.
	\section{Schedule}
		\subsection{Delivery Phases}
			\subsubsection{Overview}
			\subsubsection{Delivery Phase 1 - Proof of Concept}			
			\subsubsection{Delivery Phase 2 -NUClear Framework Integration}
		\subsection{External Dependancies}
		\subsection{Assumptions}
			We assume that there is an existing robot for the architecture to run on. We also assume that this robot will be in reasonable working condition.
