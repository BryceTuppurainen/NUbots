# The geometry of the object we are detecting in the visual mesh.
geometry:
  # How many intersections with the target object we should have.
  intersections: 6
  # The maximum distance the visual mesh will be projected for. This should be slightly further than the most distant
  # object that you wish to detect to account for noises in the projection.
  max_distance: 20
  # The radius of the object to be detected.
  radius: 0.0949996
  # The shape to project, either CYLINDER, CIRCLE or SPHERE.

# Configuration for the convolutional neural network.
network:
  # The structure of the network is defined by this list of lists.
  # Each list element corresponds to a neural network after a convolution.
  # For example a network structure of [[2], [2]] would have two convolutional layers with two single layer networks
  # after each convolution with an output size of 2.
  # Having an empty list (e.g.) [[], [2]] would correspond to two stacked convolutions.
  # The final layer of the network is always equal to the number of classes and should be omitted, typically by an
  # empty list.
  structure: [[16], [16], [16], [16], [16], [16], [16], [8], [8], [8], [8], [8], []]
  # Activation Function

  # This is a mapping of the classes to the colours that represent them in the mask images.
  # Each of the elements has a name, and an RGB value that stores it in the mask image.
  # The index of the final output layer will be the same as the order provided in this list.
  classes:
    - [ball, [255, 0, 0]]
    - [goal, [255, 255, 0]]
    - [line, [255, 255, 255]]

  # The policy to use for controlling the learning rate and number of batches when training

    # If hot_start is true, the training will restart it's training as if beginning at 0 without resetting the network

  #   learning_rate: 0.0001
  #   # The number of batches to train for
  #   batches: 250000

  # Variations to apply to the training data, note this only applies to training data and not validation.
