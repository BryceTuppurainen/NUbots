# The following values are setting the initial values nad limits for the walk engine parameters.
# Each param is the tuple [initial value, minimum, maximum]. These values are merged with the
# values in QuinticWalk.yaml for an individual, and then evaluated with the walk.
walk:
  # Full walk cycle frequency (how long it takes in seconds for a left + right steps)
  # (in Hz, > 0)
  freq: [3, 1.5, 3.5]
  # Length of double support phase in half cycle (how long both legs should be on the ground, as a ratio of how long it takes for a single step)
  # (ratio, [0:1])
  double_support_ratio: [0.1, 0.05, 0.2]
  foot:
    # Lateral distance between the feet center (how spread apart the feet should be)
    # (in m, >= 0)
    distance: [0.18, 0.12, 0.24]
    # Maximum flying foot height (how high we lift a foot from the ground)
    # (in m, >= 0)
    rise: [0.075, 0.05, 0.17]
  trunk:
    # Height of the trunk from ground (how much we bend the knee, for the entire walk, fully standing is 0.51-ish)
    # (in m, > 0)
    height: [0.45, 0.35, 0.5]
    # Trunk pitch orientation (how much we lean the torso forward or backward, does not change)
    # (in rad)
    pitch: [24 * pi / 180, -15 * pi / 180, 30 * pi / 180]
    # Trunk forward offset (how much we offset the trunk forward or backward lean when walking)
    # (in m)
    x_offset: [0.03, -0.05, 0.05]
    # Trunk lateral offset (how much we offset the trunk left or right lean when walking)
    # (in m)
    y_offset: [-0.01, 0.02, 0.02]
    # Trunk lateral oscillation amplitude ratio (how much we swing the trunk left and right when stepping)
    # (ratio, >= 0)
    swing: [0.03, 0.02, 0.05]
    # Trunk swing pause length in phase at apex (how long we keep the trunk at the max swing position, before swinging back)
    # (half cycle ratio, [0:1])
    pause: [0.1, 0.0, 0.2]
  pause:
    # Time that the walking is paused when becoming unstable
    # (in s, [0:10])
    duration: [0.5, 0.0, 2.0]
